- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Data Science.  I strive to build practical tools that automate/ease daily life such as weather prediction, news NLP analysis, video game AI systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Transformer based models to adapt (fine-tune) for real business problems.  I am also experimenting with a Unity game I created using a Machine Learning algorithm as the "computer" to play against.
- 💞️ For collaboration, I am building a framework for model assessment creating python like packages instead of copy/paste code every time I start a new analysis [modelscoring repo].
